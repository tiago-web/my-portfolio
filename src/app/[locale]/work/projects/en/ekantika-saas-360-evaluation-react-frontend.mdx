## Overview

For **Ekantika**, I worked as a **Frontend Developer** on a **SaaS platform** built to reduce the manual effort required by consultants in HR departments. The platform facilitated **360-degree employee evaluations**, giving HR managers, team members, and external participants the ability to evaluate one another across various metrics. It was designed with complete flexibility, allowing companies to customize the evaluation process according to their specific needs.

One of the early adopters was **Connect Car**, a company that utilized the platform's flexibility to adjust the questions and evaluation formats. The system supported **90-degree**, **180-degree**, and **360-degree evaluations**, and allowed companies to customize access profiles for different roles, such as **HR Managers**, **team members**, and **external evaluators**. Managers could track and evaluate multiple teams at once, while customizing the evaluation questions to fit their unique business needs.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Evaluation Profiles**: Each company could configure the platform to fit their unique workflow. The HR managers had full control to set up different types of evaluations (90°, 180°, or 360°) and adjust the questions to suit their internal requirements.
- **Multiple User Profiles**: The platform had distinct roles for **HR managers**, **evaluation participants**, and **team members**. These profiles could be customized for different levels of access and permissions, ensuring that only authorized individuals could access sensitive evaluation data.
- **Adaptable to Branding**: The SaaS was fully adaptable to each company's branding, including logos, colors, and design elements, offering a seamless experience that matched each client’s identity.
- **Detailed Reporting and Results**: After each evaluation, HR managers received comprehensive reports, providing them with a summary of the scores for each employee, categorized by various metrics (peer evaluations, manager feedback, etc.).
- **Flexible Evaluation Options**: Depending on the company’s needs, they could set up evaluations where peers, subordinates, and managers evaluated one another in a **360-degree feedback loop**, or choose 90° and 180° evaluations for simpler setups.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: As the core technology for the frontend, I built dynamic, reusable components that provided a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **SaaS Architecture**: The platform was designed to operate as a **multi-tenant SaaS**, where different clients could manage their evaluations and configurations independently.
- **REST API Integration**: Collaborating closely with the backend developer, I integrated the frontend with the backend’s **REST APIs**, ensuring real-time data fetching, updates, and reporting for users.
- **Customizable UI/UX**: Created a flexible UI that could adapt to the branding needs of each company using the SaaS, making the platform feel personalized for each client.

## Challenges and Learnings

Working on **Ekantika** was an exciting and rewarding challenge because of the platform's size and complexity. Building a **SaaS** that catered to **HR professionals** and allowed **360-degree evaluations** across various companies required thoughtful UI design and dynamic data handling.

A key challenge was ensuring that the user interface was both intuitive and adaptable. Since the HR managers had complete freedom to adjust questions and manage evaluations, we needed to ensure that the frontend was not only flexible but also simple to navigate, regardless of the complexity of the evaluation. Collaborating closely with the backend developer, we worked on integrating the **REST APIs**, ensuring seamless communication between the frontend and backend. The **multi-role access management** also added complexity, as each user type had to interact with the system in different ways.

## Collaboration and Agile Methodology

Throughout the project, I collaborated closely with the **backend developer** and the **product team** at Ekantika. We regularly discussed updates and resolved any challenges that arose. We used an **agile Kanban approach**, with weekly goals and ceremonies to track progress and ensure alignment. This agile process allowed us to remain flexible and adjust priorities based on feedback from both the product team and early users of the platform, such as **Connect Car**.

## Outcome

The **Ekantika SaaS platform** was successfully launched and provided a valuable service to HR departments, significantly reducing the manual effort involved in running employee evaluations. Companies using the platform could fully customize their evaluations, access detailed reports, and tailor the entire experience to their needs. This project was an important milestone in my career, as I had the opportunity to work on a large-scale SaaS platform and collaborate closely with a cross-functional team. The experience helped me refine my skills in **React** development, **API integration**, and **SaaS architecture**.
