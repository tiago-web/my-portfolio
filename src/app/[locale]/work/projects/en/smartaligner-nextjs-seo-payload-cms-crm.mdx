## Overview

**SmartAligner** is a company offering transparent dental aligners designed to help individuals correct their dental alignment. I developed a marketing website using **Next.js** and integrated it with **Payload CMS** to allow the SmartAligner team to easily manage and update the site's content. The platform was optimized for **SEO** and lead generation, capturing user information such as emails and phone numbers, while also allowing users to find local doctors and clinics that provide SmartAligner services.

The **Next.js** backend powers the lead generation and CRM integrations, connecting with **Pipedrive** to manage doctor data and store leads. The doctors listed on the platform are partnered with SmartAligner, offering their services to patients.

## Key Features

- **SEO Optimization**: Implemented SEO best practices to ensure the site ranks well on search engines, driving organic traffic for SmartAligner's services.
- **Payload CMS Integration**: Integrated **Payload CMS** to allow administrators to easily update content, add new pages, and create marketing components without needing developer intervention.
- **Lead Generation and CRM Integration**: Developed a lead capture system to collect user information (email and phone) and integrated it with **Pipedrive** CRM, allowing SmartAligner to track leads and customer journeys efficiently.
- **Doctor and Clinic Finder**: Built a feature that lets users find local doctors and clinics who are certified to offer SmartAligner treatments, pulling data from the CRM and displaying it dynamically on the website.
- **Responsive and Dynamic Components**: Developed dynamic, reusable components with **Next.js** to ensure that the website could adapt to new marketing needs and campaigns, while remaining fully responsive for mobile and desktop users.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Used Next.js for both the frontend and backend, ensuring fast page loading times and server-side rendering for SEO benefits.
- **Payload CMS**: Integrated Payload CMS for content management, allowing the SmartAligner team to create and edit marketing pages without needing technical expertise.
- **Pipedrive CRM**: Integrated Pipedrive to manage doctor data and leads, ensuring SmartAligner could efficiently track and convert potential customers.
- **SEO Best Practices**: Implemented advanced SEO strategies, including schema markup, meta tags, and optimized page structure, to boost search engine visibility.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Developed the site with mobile-first principles, ensuring a fully responsive experience for users on any device.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges was ensuring that the platform was optimized for **SEO** while maintaining a seamless user experience across devices. I had to balance dynamic content generation from the CMS with maintaining fast load times and effective **SEO** practices like **server-side rendering**.

Additionally, integrating **Pipedrive CRM** for both lead generation and doctor data management required careful handling of data flows to ensure that user information was captured accurately and securely. The experience gave me further insight into managing **CRM systems** and working with **CMS solutions** in combination with **Next.js** for building scalable, maintainable websites.

## Outcome

The **SmartAligner** website successfully launched and became an effective platform for **lead generation** and **customer acquisition**. The integration of **Payload CMS** and **Pipedrive CRM** allowed the team to efficiently manage content and track leads, while the SEO optimization strategies significantly improved the site's visibility on search engines. This project expanded my experience in combining **Next.js** development with **content management systems** and **CRM integrations**, resulting in a scalable solution tailored to the company's marketing needs.
