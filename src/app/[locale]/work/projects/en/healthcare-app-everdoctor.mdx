## Overview

This was my first major project where I collaborated with a backend developer to build the **EverDoctor** mobile app, a healthcare platform that allows users to manage their medical appointments and health benefits. As the sole **mobile app developer**, I used **React Native**, **React Hooks**, **styled-components**, and the **React Context API** to create a seamless experience for users to find nearby doctors, specialists, and clinics, schedule appointments, and add family members to share health benefits.

The app focused on simplifying healthcare access and appointment scheduling, making it easy for users to manage their medical needs from their smartphones.

## Key Features

- **Appointment Scheduling and Management**: Built a scheduling system where users could view and manage their upcoming appointments, with easy-to-use interfaces that allowed them to track medical visits.
- **Family Benefits Sharing**: Implemented a feature where users could add family members to their healthcare plan, allowing them to share EverDoctor benefits like doctor visits and appointments.
- **Doctor, Specialist, and Clinic Search**: Developed a search system that allowed users to find nearby doctors, specialists, and clinics based on their location and book appointments directly within the app.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Used React Native to build the cross-platform mobile app for both iOS and Android, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Styled Components**: Implemented styled-components to create modular, scalable, and reusable UI components with custom themes that ensured a consistent design throughout the app.
- **React Hooks**: Utilized React Hooks to manage state and side effects, simplifying the codebase while making the app more maintainable and efficient.
- **React Context API**: Leveraged the React Context API for global state management, ensuring seamless data sharing across different components without prop drilling.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the main challenges in this project was ensuring that the **user experience** was smooth and intuitive, particularly when managing appointment schedules. Another challenge was optimizing the **performance** of the app, particularly with the **search functionality** for doctors, specialists, and clinics.
